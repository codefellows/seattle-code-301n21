# Final Project Kick-off

## Overview

Today is the last day of formal lecture. For the remainder of this course, you will be working with your assigned project team to build out your final project. On the last day of class, your group will present your project.

Also, the Code 301 final exam will become available today and is due at the end of lab time. This exam also serves as the Code 401 entrance exam. However, it is a pass/fail graded portion of this course, regardless of your intent to advance to a Code 401 course.

The exam is open book, open Google, open Stack Overflow, whatever resources you want to use, but it must be completed individually. You may not get help from anyone else, except from your instructor. The exam is designed to cover the full range of what was taught in this course. The intent is to measure not your memorization skills, but your resourcefulness and your ability to adapt and problem-solve. Give yourself adequate time for the exam.
